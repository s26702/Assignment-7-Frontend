    See https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-bidirectional-relationships-and-infinite-recursion

    We can either use identity or managed references (and backwards references) to avoid
    deeply copying the object tree. Anyway, we should limit how much data is serialized
    in JSON (in the worst case the complete database is following suit).
